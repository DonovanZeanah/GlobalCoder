# Challenge 1 

A challenge to make an HTML page and put some content on it, then style it and use some javascript in future challenges.

>**Note**: Do not use bootstrap or any other grid layout (for now).

## Create the Template

To start, create a template to house all of your pages, with a `content` section that will change from page to page.

>**Hint:** Use this page for guidance: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp

1. Create your "template" page

	Your page should include:  

	- head
	- navigation bar
	- A content section that will have the `meat` of every page
	- Optional Left/Right nav/etc
	- footer
		
1. Add Navigation items

	- At least three items in your nav bar
		-i.e. Sports/Weather/Opinion
			Science/Tech/Business
			Home/About/Contact Us

	- Three items will navigate to three pages with identical template

	- When you are on each page, the page you are on will be highlighted in the navigation bar

## Create the pages

1. Add pages for each navigation item

## Create a page with a reusable component (repeated html for now)

This page will have the same html over and over again but with different details such as a "forum" or "for sale" page  
- This page will have one of the layouts like:

- A list of articles/topics, with an image, a description, and a link to a page that shows the article
- A photo gallery of objects for sale with info about the item that is for sale

- repeatable component (examples)
