## Week 3

Week 3 we learned about SQL Server and utilizing the programming and querying tools to store relational data.  We learned about one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.  We learned how to restore a database from a backup.  We also covered things like views, stored procedures, user-defined functions, and all of the basic CRUD concepts for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from our tables in SQL Server.  We made our own Movies DB and took a quick look at using it from code to position us for the next module.
