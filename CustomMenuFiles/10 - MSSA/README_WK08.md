## Week 8 - HTML/JS/CSS

## Day 1 - 

Today we completed HTML and started working as teams on a couple of projects. We also learned about working as team members on a shared repository at GitHub

### Morning

1. Finished HTML [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

1. Determined teams

### Afternoon

GitHub team repositories and HTML work

1. Learned about working as a team at GitHub

    - Using branches
        - git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;
        - git push -u origin &lt;branch-name&gt;
        - make changes
        - git add .
        - git commit -m "my changes"
        - git push
    
    - Create pull request
        - ask to merge your branch to main
        - see if there are any conflicts.  If so, you must resolve them

    - Merge pull request
        - merge at GitHub
        - delete branch at GitHub

    - Checkout main locally
        - fetch the changes
        - pull the changes (sync)
    
    - Delete your branch that was merged
        - git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;  
        - [Force delete: use carefully!] git branch -D &lt;branch-name&gt;

    - Create a new branch from main for the next set of changes
        - git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

    - Publish the new branch
        - git push -u origin &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

    - Make changes...

## Conclusion

Learning GIT to work together is a great win at this point, as by the end of the next couple of weeks there really won't be too many problems left with GIT that we don't know.

We also are hopeful that a real project will help us to discern how to apply things we're learning with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
