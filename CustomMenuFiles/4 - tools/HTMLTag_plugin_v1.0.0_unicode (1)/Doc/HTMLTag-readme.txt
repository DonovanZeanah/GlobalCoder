HTMLTag plug-in for Notepad++
Written by vor0nwe (Martijn Coppoolse) - http://martijn.coppoolse.com/software/
 using Delphi 10.1 Berlin
Part of the Npp-plugins project - http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/
Hosted on http://fossil.2of4.net/npp_htmltag/


[Introduction]
This plug-in provides three core functions to Notepad++:
- HTML and XML tag jumping, like the built-in brace matching (Ctrl+B / Shift+Ctrl+B), and selection
  of tags and/or contents.
- HTML entity encoding/decoding (example: é to &eacute;)
- JS character encoding/decoding (example: é to \u00E9)

It originated in these requests on the Plugin Development forum on SourceForge.net:
- http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4284078
- http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4443898


[Installation]
As usual:  
Extract the DLL and accompanying files to the plugins folder under 
%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++ (or wherever you're running Notepad++ from) or %AppData%\Notepad++, and 
(re)start Np++.


[Usage]
- Ctrl+T to select the matching tag;
- Shift+Ctrl+T to select both tags and the entire contents in between. 

- Ctrl+E to encode all selected non-ASCII characters to their HTML entities;
- Shift+Ctrl+E to dEcode all selected HTML entities.
- Ctrl+J to encode all selected non-ASCII character to their Javascript entities;
- Shift+Ctrl+J to dEcode all selected JS entities.

All commands are available under the Plugins menu item 'HTML Tag'; the shortcut keys can be adjusted 
with the shortcut mapper.

  leave valid tags and entities alone)
* Add command to select tags only (and leave the contents out of the selection)
* Make it play nice(r) with PHP & ASP tags (either highlight those separately or ignore them)
* Add option to encode entities 'as-you-type'
* Add option to close tags 'as-you-type' (type '</' and the rest will be inserted automagically)
* [Request#2147949] drop down a list of tags after '<'
