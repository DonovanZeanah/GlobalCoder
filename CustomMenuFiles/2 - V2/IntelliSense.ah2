; IntelliSense (based on the v1 script by Rajat)
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script watches while you edit an AutoHotkey script.  When it sees you
; type a command followed by a comma or space, it displays that command's
; parameter list to guide you.  In addition, you can press Ctrl+F1 (or
; another hotkey of your choice) to display that command's page in the help
; file. To dismiss the parameter list, press Escape or Enter.

; CONFIGURATION SECTION: Customize the script with the following variables.

; The hotkey below is pressed to display the current command's page in the
; help file:
g_HelpHotkey := "^F1"

; The string below must exist somewhere in the active window's title for
; IntelliSense to be in effect while you're typing.  Make it blank to have
; IntelliSense operate in all windows.  Make it Pad to have it operate in
; editors such as Metapad, Notepad, and Textpad.  Make it .ahk to have it
; operate only when a .ahk file is open in Notepad, Metapad, etc.
g_Editor := ".ahk"

; If you wish to have a different icon for this script to distinguish it from
; other scripts in the tray, provide the filename below (leave blank to have
; no icon). For example: E:\stuff\Pics\icons\GeoIcons\Information.ico
g_Icon := ""

; END OF CONFIGURATION SECTION (do not make changes below this point unless
; you want to change the basic functionality of the script).
