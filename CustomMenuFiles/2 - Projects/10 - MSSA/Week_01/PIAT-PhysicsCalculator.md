# Putting it All Together (PIAT - week 1)

To put everything together for this week, we're going to complete a team activity this afternoon.  We will split into five teams of three.  Each team will have 2.5 hours to complete your work.

## Scenario

A local physicist has requested you build a program that allows them to choose from one of many formulas to perform calculations.  You will be assigned one formula per team.  

## Requirements

The following requirements define the problem:

1. Create a program that allows the user to perform as many different calculations as they want to run during each session    

1. Give them a menu to perform one of many different calculations  
  
1. Validate all input  

1. Confirm all input from the user  

1. Perform the required operation  

## Hints/Goals

The following things need to be considered in your solution:

1. Don't forget about PseudoCode and algorithms  
1. Plan first, code to your plan - don't just try to hammer out code  
1. Eliminate code complexity  
1. Utilize good naming standards/descriptive naming
1. When possible, reuse code  
1. When possible, utilize constants
1. No hard breaks in your program execution (unhandled errors/bad input/etc)  

## Calculations (operations)

The following operations will be assigned, one per team:

1. Density

    density = mass / volume

1. Energy 

    energy = mass * the speed of light

1. Force

    force = mass * accelleration

1. Momentum

    momentum = mass * velocity

1. Speed

    speed = distanceTravelled / time

## Conclusion

At the end, we will pick one solution that is robust and combine the all of the calculations to create one final program (time permitting)
