  Thank you Bob!



   Quick list of items our builder Eddy has flagged for us to review during your site visit:  



        1. Existing Foundation: the existing foundation's stability given its depth in relation to the new first level ground floor 

           (as it's re-poured flat in relation to the height at the front of the garage and in relation to the N and S side setbacks 

           on the outside).  

        2. North Side Setback Drainage: whether we need to make any additional provisions for drainage there.  

        3. South Side Setback Drainage & Slope: sounds like the slope in the architectural plans would result in the setback 

           not meeting the planned steps at the appropriate height
 noting that it'd be better to replace it 

           completely as we go. We'll want to confirm the existing plans accommodate for that.

          Thank you Bob!  



          Quick list of items our builder Eddy has flagged for us to review during your site visit:  



               1. Existing Foundation: the existing foundation's stability given its depth in relation to the new first level 

                  ground floor (as it's re-poured flat in relation to the height at the front of the garage and in relation to 

                 the N and S side setbacks on the outside).  

               2. North Side Setback Drainage: whether we need to make any additional provisions for drainage 

                 there.  

               3. South Side Setback Drainage & Slope: sounds like the slope in the architectural plans would result in 

                 the setback not meeting the planned steps at the appropriate height
 and that it will be easier to keep 

                  it flat [and provide drain(s) as necessary].  

               4. North Side Setback Retailing Wall // Property Line Challenges: existing plans call for a gently sloping 

                  ramp from front to back. Main concern here is the relatively shallow depth of the North side 

                  neighbor's foundation along the property line (below their rear steps and front steps) may risk 

                  compromising them. Primary uses for the N side setback are: a) rolling 3 trash cans to the curb and 

                  back and b) for short-term renters
 so a smooth ramp was preferable to steps up and down.  

               5. Support for Existing 2nd to 3rd Level Stairs [and associated design of the powder room
 

                  closet and small hallway on the 2nd level): the upper part of the main staircase looks like it was 

                  previously supported by very low slats of the ceiling. Now that the floor's been raised and the ceiling 

                  (mostly) demo'd
 our builder's concerned that the stairs area will need more support and the existing 

                  design of the powder room and pantry would result in a very small door into the powder room. We 

                 want to confirm whether his perception is correct and if so
 implement an updated design that is more 

                 functional. 

               6. NorthWest Corner Complete Demo: our builder found the (previously-added) addition in this area had 

                  inadequate framing (2x2's) that would be unlikely to pass inspection. Since we were already demoing 

                  2 of the 3 walls there on the 2nd and 3rd levels
 noting 

                 that it'd be better to replace it completely as we go. We'll want to confirm the existing plans 

                  accommodate for that.

              Is Bob available to start a drop later Tuesday instead (4pm or 4:30pm)? I’d like to get 

              our architect there at the same time so we can go over everything with the builder together 

              and they're tied up in meetings until 3:30pm.

To: Bob <Bobby3@yahoo.com>



  Thanks everyone for making the time to meet yesterday and Happy New Year again! Feels like we've got the makings of a 

  great team here
 and I really appreciate everyone being so thoughtful and efficient with helping us overcome these 

  challenges.   



  On this email thread are:  



          Structural Engineers: Fred & Rob 

          Architects: Bill & Dane 

          General Contractor: Eddy 



  To ensure we're all on the same page
 I wanted to capture what I think are the target solutions to each of the challenges 

   Eddy has encountered thus far
 as well as our feedback on the proposed solutions. Please take a read of the below 

  and my notes to the plans attached on paged 4
 5 and 6 to confirm we are all on the same page or propose alternatives 

  that might better meet our collective needs.  



        20-01-08 Smith Combined_JS Notes.pdf 



  Issues List
 Proposed Solutions & Feedback 



      Existing Foundation: the existing foundation's stability given its depth in relation to the new first level ground floor (as 

  it's re-poured flat in relation to the height at the front of the garage and in relation to the N and S side setbacks on the 

  outside).  

              Proposed Solution: Sounds like Bob recommended having the first level poured with a slight decline 

          towards the middle of the first level so that it'd be higher on the outside so that the existing foundation doesn't need 

          substantial retrofitting.  

              Owner Feedback: Sounds like a sound plan
 provided the slope is so minimal as to not be noticeable or have a 

          material impact on the quality of using the first level. Please note that the first level will be living space (not garage)
 

          so having the ground floor as flat as possible is relatively important.  

      North Side Setback Drainage: whether we need to make any additional provisions for drainage there.  

      South Side Setback Drainage & Slope: sounds like the slope in the architectural plans would result in the setback not 

  meeting the planned steps at the appropriate height
 and that it will be easier to keep it flat [and provide drain(s) as 

  necessary].  

      North Side Setback Retailing Wall // Property Line Challenges: existing plans call for a gently sloping ramp from front to 

  back. Main concern here is the relatively shallow depth of the North side neighbor's foundation along the property line 

  (below their rear steps and front steps) may risk compromising them. Primary uses for the N side setback are: a) rolling 3 

  trash cans to the curb and back and b) for short-term renters
 so a smooth ramp was preferable to steps up and down.  

              Proposed Solution (to all the above): we discussed not lowering the new foundation area (called the KID'S 

          REC ROOM in the current plans
 or the N and S side setbacks near it.  

              Owner Feedback: wondering whether we can keep the height of the N and S side setbacks at their previous 

          levels (i.e. even with the garage floor)
 but still lower the new area of the Kids' Rec room and small patio outside it. 

          That way we'd de-risk messing with the neighbors' foundations
 but still get the additional ceiling height in the 

          ground floor short-term rental unit living space. Note that we'd then completely remove the first door into the 

          garage space. Please see a bunch of notes on page 5 of the attached for what I'm thinking. Defer to Bill 

          to update any necessary drainage and slopes on both setbacks 

      Support for Existing 2nd to 3rd Level Stairs [and associated design of the powder room
 closet and small 

  hallway on the 2nd level): the upper part of the main staircase looks like it was previously supported by very low slats of 

  the ceiling. Now that the floor's been raised and the ceiling (mostly) demo'd
 our builder's concerned that the stairs area 

  will need more support and the existing design of the powder room and pantry would result in a very small door into the 

  powder room. We want to confirm whether his perception is correct and if so
 implement an updated design that is more 

  functional. 

                                                                                                                      

             Proposed Solution: Eddy and Bob seemed to agree that side bracing could be added so that the 

         ceiling height wouldn't need to be dramatically reduced and we could follow through with the original layouts of the 

         pantry
 closet and powder room. Bill to confirm this will all be code compliant. Notes on page 6 of the 

         attached plans...  

    NorthWest Corner Complete Demo: our builder found the (previously-added) addition in this area had inadequate 

framing (2x2's) that would be unlikely to pass inspection. Since we were already demoing 2 of the 3 walls there on the 2nd 

and 3rd levels
 noting that it'd be better to replace it completely as we go. 

We'll want to confirm the existing plans accommodate for that.  

             Solution: Doesn't sound like any updates are required here.

   Happy Saturday  

   this are the elevations that I was Able to find out the south side Neighbor  

   Retaining wall is 6 inches lower than our zero elevations and also 6 inch lower then our house foundation 



   The north side neighbor
 the bottom of their foundation is 11 inch higher that our zero elevations also 11 inch higher than 

   The bottom of our foundation  



   All this means that the garage slab is going to be higher minimum 4 inch in the sides to make our connection and then 

   Slope to the center
 this means that the slope will be noticed

   Sorry that I take time to respond but I was trying to find a good way to explain

           Thanks for the great update! 



           Good to hear we can keep the higher ceilings in the living space there -- that'll go a long way to make that 

           space more inviting.  



           I just spoke to Eddy and he's going to work to get us 3 answers ASAP
 namely:  



                 1. Finish height of the South side setback (to fully cover the neighbor's retaining wall and our 

                    foundation).  

                 2. Finish height of the North side setback (to fully cover the neighbor's foundation and ours).  

                 3. Slope necessary to make the garage work (i.e. how many inches it'll need to decline and over how 

                    many feet that decline will need to take place). [this one scares me the most as (again) the garage 

                    will be living space... hopefully the slope will be so minimal as to barely be noticeable].  



           We agree with your plan on the second level powder room area. Let us know if you need anything on that
 

           and thanks for trying to get that answer ASAP so we know if the existing plans are good to go or we need to 

           go to plan B. 



           Best

              Thanks for the call Bob! Very helpful as always! 

                

              Hey Joe
 here are some updates from our call:  

              1. We can keep the kids rec room to be -18" and maintain the ceiling height you are looking for. 

                

              2. We can modify the retaining wall as you showed in your sketch and make the exit path as you showed 

              in your sketch. 

                

              3. Bob and I determined that we won't need to resubmit these revisions related to retaining wall to the 

              city as they are minor and can be reviewed by inspector with a field sketch. 

                



                                                                                                                               

4. For the second floor bathroom
 I highly recommend (and Bob agreed) we review it with the plan 

checker and get his input
 because if we build it and inspector won't accept it
 we are in big trouble. I will 

plan to go to the city on early next week to review it with either Joe or any other plan checker available.  

  

5. Eddy will need to give me the finish level of the North and South setbacks so we can determine 

the number and locations of steps if they are needed. 

  

6. Regarding the garage
 Bob explained that there will be a gentle slope from South-West corner of 

the garage to the North-East corner of the garage
 in order to be able to use the existing foundation 

(saves costs)
 but Eddy will need to determine that slope as it is only visible on site. Please note that 

the slope is only going to be in the garage
 nowhere else.  

  

Let us know if you have any questions. We will need those levels from Eddy to finalize updating the 

plans and will go to the city to review the bathroom on second floor asap early next week. 

Thanks! 

Bill

   Thx Bill! 

     

   Quick comments back in red in the attached pdf.   

     

   Bill
 could you please connect with Bob ASAP to talk through the open items and help us 

   develop a plan of attack on each of them? If there are not too painful ways of (still) having the Kids' Rec 

   Room have higher ceilings and maintain the existing 2nd level powder room/pantry design
 then great. I 

   think we're all agreed that we don't want to mess with either neighbor's foundations. 

     

   We'll also want to confirm that the resulting slope of the first level will be barely noticeable and not 

   affect its usability
 and agree on exactly what we need to resubmit to the city
 if anything.  

     

   Thanks!

  Thank you Bob!



   Quick list of items our builder Eddy has flagged for us to review during your site visit:  



        1. Existing Foundation: the existing foundation's stability given its depth in relation to the new first level ground floor 

           (as it's re-poured flat in relation to the height at the front of the garage and in relation to the N and S side setbacks 

           on the outside).  

        2. North Side Setback Drainage: whether we need to make any additional provisions for drainage there.  

        3. South Side Setback Drainage & Slope: sounds like the slope in the architectural plans would result in the setback 

           not meeting the planned steps at the appropriate height
 noting that it'd be better to replace it 

           completely as we go. We'll want to confirm the existing plans accommodate for that.  



   My cell is 213-383-0987 if anyone needs to get in touch. We appreciate you all making yourselves available on short 

   notice and Happy New Year! 



   Joe 



   PS -- I'll send out a calendar invite as well.

     4 pm will work
 we will be waiting for the items to be reviewed during our site visit.

                 there.  

               3. South Side Setback Drainage & Slope: sounds like the slope in the architectural plans would result in 

                 the setback not meeting the planned steps at the appropriate height
 and that it will be easier to keep 

                  it flat [and provide drain(s) as necessary].  

               4. North Side Setback Retailing Wall // Property Line Challenges: existing plans call for a gently sloping 

                  ramp from front to back. Main concern here is the relatively shallow depth of the North side 

                  neighbor's foundation along the property line (below their rear steps and front steps) may risk 

                  compromising them. Primary uses for the N side setback are: a) rolling 3 trash cans to the curb and 

                  back and b) for short-term renters
 so a smooth ramp was preferable to steps up and down.  

               5. Support for Existing 2nd to 3rd Level Stairs [and associated design of the powder room
 

                  closet and small hallway on the 2nd level): the upper part of the main staircase looks like it was 

                  previously supported by very low slats of the ceiling. Now that the floor's been raised and the ceiling 

                  (mostly) demo'd
 our builder's concerned that the stairs area will need more support and the existing 

                  design of the powder room and pantry would result in a very small door into the powder room. We

 implement an updated design that is more 

                 functional.

                  inadequate framing (2x2's) that would be unlikely to pass inspection. Since we were already demoing 

                  2 of the 3 walls there on the 2nd and 3rd levels
 noting 

                 that it'd be better to replace it completely as we go. We'll want to confirm the existing plans 

                  accommodate for that.

              Is Bob available to start a drop later Tuesday instead (4pm or 4:30pm)? I’d like to get 

              our architect there at the same time so we can go over everything with the builder together 

              and they're tied up in meetings until 3:30pm.  

                

              We'll send over some detail about the troubling items tomorrow.

To: Bob <Bobby3@yahoo.com>



  Thanks everyone for making the time to meet yesterday and Happy New Year again! Feels like we've got the makings of a 

  great team here
 and I really appreciate everyone being so thoughtful and efficient with helping us overcome these 

  challenges.   



  On this email thread are:  



          Structural Engineers: Fred & Rob 

          Architects: Bill & Dane 

          General Contractor: Eddy 



  To ensure we're all on the same page
 I wanted to capture what I think are the target solutions to each of the challenges 

   Eddy has encountered thus far
 as well as our feedback on the proposed solutions. Please take a read of the below 

  and my notes to the plans attached on paged 4
 5 and 6 to confirm we are all on the same page or propose alternatives 

  that might better meet our collective needs.  



        20-01-08 Smith Combined_JS Notes.pdf 



  Issues List
 Proposed Solutions & Feedback 



      Existing Foundation: the existing foundation's stability given its depth in relation to the new first level ground floor (as 

  it's re-poured flat in relation to the height at the front of the garage and in relation to the N and S side setbacks on the 

  outside).  

              Proposed Solution: Sounds like Bob recommended having the first level poured with a slight decline 

          towards the middle of the first level so that it'd be higher on the outside so that the existing foundation doesn't need 

          substantial retrofitting.  

              Owner Feedback: Sounds like a sound plan
 provided the slope is so minimal as to not be noticeable or have a 

          material impact on the quality of using the first level. Please note that the first level will be living space (not garage)
 

          so having the ground floor as flat as possible is relatively important.  

      North Side Setback Drainage: whether we need to make any additional provisions for drainage there.  

      South Side Setback Drainage & Slope: sounds like the slope in the architectural plans would result in the setback not 

  meeting the planned steps at the appropriate height
 and that it will be easier to keep it flat [and provide drain(s) as 

  necessary].  

      North Side Setback Retailing Wall // Property Line Challenges: existing plans call for a gently sloping ramp from front to 

  back. Main concern here is the relatively shallow depth of the North side neighbor's foundation along the property line 

  (below their rear steps and front steps) may risk compromising them. Primary uses for the N side setback are: a) rolling 3 

  trash cans to the curb and back and b) for short-term renters
 so a smooth ramp was preferable to steps up and down.  

              Proposed Solution (to all the above): we discussed not lowering the new foundation area (called the KID'S 

          REC ROOM in the current plans
 or the N and S side setbacks near it.  

              Owner Feedback: wondering whether we can keep the height of the N and S side setbacks at their previous 

          levels (i.e. even with the garage floor)
 but still lower the new area of the Kids' Rec room and small patio outside it. 

          That way we'd de-risk messing with the neighbors' foundations
 but still get the additional ceiling height in the 

          ground floor short-term rental unit living space. Note that we'd then completely remove the first door into the 

          garage space. Please see a bunch of notes on page 5 of the attached for what I'm thinking. Defer to Bill 

          to update any necessary drainage and slopes on both setbacks 

      Support for Existing 2nd to 3rd Level Stairs [and associated design of the powder room
 closet and small 

  hallway on the 2nd level): the upper part of the main staircase looks like it was previously supported by very low slats of 

  the ceiling. Now that the floor's been raised and the ceiling (mostly) demo'd
 our builder's concerned that the stairs area 

  will need more support and the existing design of the powder room and pantry would result in a very small door into the 

  powder room. We want to confirm whether his perception is correct and if so
 implement an updated design that is more 

  functional. 

                                                                                                                      

             Proposed Solution: Eddy and Bob seemed to agree that side bracing could be added so that the 

         ceiling height wouldn't need to be dramatically reduced and we could follow through with the original layouts of the 

         pantry
 closet and powder room. Bill to confirm this will all be code compliant. Notes on page 6 of the 

         attached plans...  

    NorthWest Corner Complete Demo: our builder found the (previously-added) addition in this area had inadequate 

framing (2x2's) that would be unlikely to pass inspection. Since we were already demoing 2 of the 3 walls there on the 2nd 

and 3rd levels
 noting that it'd be better to replace it completely as we go. 

We'll want to confirm the existing plans accommodate for that.  

             Solution: Doesn't sound like any updates are required here.

   Happy Saturday  

   this are the elevations that I was Able to find out the south side Neighbor  

   Retaining wall is 6 inches lower than our zero elevations and also 6 inch lower then our house foundation 



   The north side neighbor
 the bottom of their foundation is 11 inch higher that our zero elevations also 11 inch higher than 

   The bottom of our foundation  



   All this means that the garage slab is going to be higher minimum 4 inch in the sides to make our connection and then 

   Slope to the center
 this means that the slope will be noticed   

   Thomas Construction  



   Sorry that I take time to respond but I was trying to find a good way to explain

           Thanks for the great update! 



           Good to hear we can keep the higher ceilings in the living space there -- that'll go a long way to make that 

           space more inviting.  



           I just spoke to Eddy and he's going to work to get us 3 answers ASAP
 namely:  



                 1. Finish height of the South side setback (to fully cover the neighbor's retaining wall and our 

                    foundation).  

                 2. Finish height of the North side setback (to fully cover the neighbor's foundation and ours).  

                 3. Slope necessary to make the garage work (i.e. how many inches it'll need to decline and over how 

                    many feet that decline will need to take place). [this one scares me the most as (again) the garage 

                    will be living space... hopefully the slope will be so minimal as to barely be noticeable].  



           We agree with your plan on the second level powder room area. Let us know if you need anything on that
 

           and thanks for trying to get that answer ASAP so we know if the existing plans are good to go or we need to 

           go to plan B. 



           Best

              Thanks for the call Bob! Very helpful as always! 

                

              Hey Joe
 here are some updates from our call:  

              1. We can keep the kids rec room to be -18" and maintain the ceiling height you are looking for. 

                

              2. We can modify the retaining wall as you showed in your sketch and make the exit path as you showed 

              in your sketch. 

                

              3. Bob and I determined that we won't need to resubmit these revisions related to retaining wall to the 

              city as they are minor and can be reviewed by inspector with a field sketch. 

                



                                                                                                                               

4. For the second floor bathroom
 I highly recommend (and Bob agreed) we review it with the plan 

checker and get his input
 because if we build it and inspector won't accept it
 we are in big trouble. I will 

plan to go to the city on early next week to review it with either Joe or any other plan checker available.  

  

5. Eddy will need to give me the finish level of the North and South setbacks so we can determine 

the number and locations of steps if they are needed. 

  

6. Regarding the garage
 Bob explained that there will be a gentle slope from South-West corner of 

the garage to the North-East corner of the garage
 in order to be able to use the existing foundation 

(saves costs)
 but Eddy will need to determine that slope as it is only visible on site. Please note that 

the slope is only going to be in the garage
 nowhere else.  

  

Let us know if you have any questions. We will need those levels from Eddy to finalize updating the 

plans and will go to the city to review the bathroom on second floor asap early next week. 

Thanks! 

Bill

   Thx Bill! 

     

   Quick comments back in red in the attached pdf.   

     

   Bill
 could you please connect with Bob ASAP to talk through the open items and help us 

   develop a plan of attack on each of them? If there are not too painful ways of (still) having the Kids' Rec 

   Room have higher ceilings and maintain the existing 2nd level powder room/pantry design
 then great. I 

   think we're all agreed that we don't want to mess with either neighbor's foundations. 

     

   We'll also want to confirm that the resulting slope of the first level will be barely noticeable and not 

   affect its usability
 and agree on exactly what we need to resubmit to the city
 if anything.  

     

   Thanks! 

     

   Joe

                               Hey ted -- just checking in to see if 

                               you’ve heard any feedback from 

                               Eddy. We haven’t heard a peep 

                               from him yet after sending him that 

                               document 



                               Just exchanged text messages from 

                               him but he hasn’t yet given any 

                               indication of what he wants to do going 

                               forward. Here’s my last text to him: The 

                               document we sent you offers an 

                               additional $50k -- which is the most 

                               we’re able to commit to at this stage -- 

                               and ties it to future milestones and 

                               some additional conditions. Let me 

                               know if you have any questions about it 

                               and whether you want to proceed 

                               based on that or just continue on under 

                               the original agreement. We really want 

                               to make this work for the long-term 

                               with you Eddy and appreciate you 

                               continuing to work in good faith to 

                               advance our project in the right way. 



I haven’t talked with him since 

Wednesday. I’ll call him today to see
