Week 12: 2023.01.03 - 2022.01.05

## Week 12 - MVC/Web API

## Day 1 - 

On Day 1 we looked at the Web API

### Morning

1. We worked through the Web API Lab from the MVC training, with Rohin volunteering to lead

This was the final module for the courseware that we completed as we've already seen working with Azure and Application Insights

### Afternoon

1. Project Time

In the afternoon, we worked on our individual projects.  We spent a lot of time working through joins and many-to-many relationships on Patrick's project.

## Day 2 -

On Day 2, we did UI work

### Morning

1. We had Mursal lead us through a number of important UI changes

- Reworked the create/edit form to have two column layout
- Added DataTables
- Set links for Contacts and made sure it didn't show unless authorized
- Added Delete confirm javascript
- Added a bootstrap modal to display contact details

### Afternoon

1. In the afternoon, we worked on projects again

- We had a number of user concerns for scaffolding and using a custom user, adding the fields to the registration page, and displaying the user details on the login partial.  We spent time troubleshooting and implementing things on Mark's machine

## Day 3 -

More MVC and some Blazor

### Morning  

On Day 3, we started with two questions

1. How do you bind multiple properties/classes for utilization on the view

    We discussed a solution using a ViewModel

    We learned the concept of getting data to the form from multiple classes put into a custom viewmodel class.

    We need to figure out how to post everything back from the viewmodel.  This could involve display and/or editor templates, but needs to ensure that the important properties to track are posted back for use in the server-side.

1. Azure App Service/Application Insights/GitHub Actions

    We spent a minimal amount of time spinning up a new .Net 7 app, instrumented app insights, put the code into GitHub, had GitHub publish to azure with a pipeline.

    We then built a couple of custom calls to show telemetry injection and working with Application Insights from code, even from your local machine.

1. After the questions, we started working on the [https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop](dotnet presentations blazor workshop)

### Afternoon

Work on your projects or keep working on Blazor

1. Discussions around a day in the life of a developer.
