# What is this repository for?

This is my main repository, for stuff I work on and use most

It's not meant to be used for anyone other than me, due to endless dependencies and what would seem like clutter to someone who's, once again, not me

# You _will_ get an error

This repository is _not_ "plug-and-play": if you try to clone it and run the main script (Main\Keys.ahk) without changing a bunch of stuff, you _will_ get an error

If you still want to, I recommend checking out lib-v2\Paths.ahk, since it's the library that takes care of the paths used in all of the scripts and some libraries
