Write a functionclass Solution { public int[] solution(int N); }
that, given an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0. 
The function can return any such array.For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1, 0, −3, 2] or [−2, 1, −4, 5]. 

The answer [1, −1, 1, 3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice).
 For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [−1, 0, 1] (but there are many more correct answers).


 function(int_N){
 	loop, int_n
 	
 }
