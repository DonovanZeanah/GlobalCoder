# GlobalCoder
IDE Independent, Language Independent Programming tool for windows.

# Notice : 
- This is the version I actively use, so configuration for personal use is necessary. I have remapped my RCTRL as f24, with f24 & rshift being my main activator, as well as RCTRL+RSHIFT for contingency. 

# Main Use :
- [Passive Functionality]  Words that have been previously entered will be auto-completeable with case sensitivity. This helps with coding in, for ex. C# and other case-sensitive languages, as well as case insensitive languages. When words are autocompleted they are added to the SQL database, which is also keeping track of the number of times activated (The frequency count of a word thats autocompleted.)

- [Active Functionality] Calling the main menu (RCTRL+Rshift) will populate a Toolbar at the cursor location, used to call upon and bring active/run notes, snippet examples, links, executables, other scripts, folder locations, shortcuts, etc. Arrow Keys usable for navigation within the structure! The Idea is to take notes, code, research, and organize in a real-time scenario, whether from Youtube video instruction, Instructor led Teams or Zoom class(of any kind, not just coding -really.), and over time amounting to a Grand Archive of at-hand references of past-learned lessons. Otherwise being: A project organizer thats *Language and IDE independancy* of any IDE, Text Editor, and even browser. Using Windows/Microsofts [UI Automation/Accessibility Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-overview) to populate tool menu at cursor/caret position.

-[Research Functionality] 
- ```
"Ghost Google" as I like to call it. An interface-less google search, with auto tab grouping via the [tab groups extension in chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-groups-extension/nplimhmoanghlebhdiboeellhgmgommi). This minimizes the traditional, regular act of searching for chrome in taskbar, clicking it, focusing search bar, writing search query, clicking to search, grouping, etc... aka every google search is .1 sec away and is conducted atleast 5-10 sec. faster. Google is to a coder an axe to a lumberjack. Each swing of a main tool should be as powerful an efficient as it can get. and so it is.

"Ghost Notes" Again, same concept. A 'UI-LESS' notetaker, allowing quick saving of snippets, commands, speaker notes, links, reference, etc.
```

-[Organizational Functionality] Quick-Shortcuts, Project Folders, and general folder management available anywhere, without need to navigate explorer.exe etc.
