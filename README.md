# GlobalCoder
IDE Independent, Language Independent Programming tool for windows.

# Notice : 
- This is the version I actively use, so configuration for personal use is necessary. I have remapped my RCTRL as f24, with f24 & rshift being my main activator, as well as RCTRL+RSHIFT for contingency.

Replace this line with whatever key activator you like.
```
f24 & Rctrl::
```
... same for all other key combinations.

## Delete all folders/contents of the folders that reside in /CustomMenuFiles.
## If /CustomMenuFiles contains a folder and that folder is empty, GlobalCoder will error. (Always keep atleast 1 file in a folder)




# Main Use :
- ## [Passive Functionality]  Words that have been previously entered will be auto-completeable with case sensitivity. This helps with coding in, for ex. C# and other case-sensitive languages, as well as case insensitive languages. When words are autocompleted they are added to the SQLite database, which is also keeping track of the number of times activated (The frequency count of a word thats autocompleted.)

- ## [Active Functionality] Calling the main menu (RCTRL+Rshift) will populate a Toolbar at the cursor location, used to call upon and bring active/run notes, snippet examples, links, executables, other scripts, folder locations, shortcuts, etc. Arrow Keys usable for navigation within the structure! The Idea is to take notes, code, research, and organize in a real-time scenario, whether from Youtube video instruction, Instructor led Teams or Zoom class(of any kind, not just coding -really.), and over time amounting to a Grand Archive of at-hand references of past-learned lessons. Otherwise being: A project organizer thats *Language and IDE independant*, Swiss-Army Text Editor tool, and even its own browser. 

# A little info on Autohotkey

## Uses Windows/Microsofts [UI Automation/Accessibility Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-overview) to populate tool menu at cursor/caret position.
## Uses Edge's Webview2 for browser example.
## Uses SQLite for Typing Aid, CSV for 'pasted-file' tracking, .INI for some settings & config. (all of this probably SHOULD be in one system/will be eventually, but I like to keep the references to each as learning examples.)
## Autohotkey, by nature, impliments: 
- Win32 API (GUIs, Controls, Menu-ing system, Window-ing system)
- COM objects (MS Office impliments)
- C++ and .dll call-ability

### "If Windows is the earth, and google is the metal of a developer's sword...
- Autohotkey has the potential to function as that swords hilt"

# Some of the "swift-army-knife-like" features:

### - [Research Functionality] 

"Ghost Google" as I like to call it. An interface-less google search, with auto tab grouping via the [tab groups extension in chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-groups-extension/nplimhmoanghlebhdiboeellhgmgommi). This minimizes the traditional, regular act of searching for chrome in taskbar, clicking it, focusing search bar, writing search query, clicking to search, grouping, etc... aka every google search is .1 sec away and is conducted atleast 5-10 sec. faster. Google is to a coder an axe to a lumberjack. Each swing of a main tool should be as powerful an efficient as it can get. and so it is.



### - "Ghost Notes" 

Again, same concept. A 'UI-LESS' notetaker, allowing quick saving of snippets, commands, speaker notes, links, reference, etc.


### - [Organizational Functionality] Quick-Shortcuts, Project Folders, and general folder management available anywhere, without need to navigate explorer.exe etc. 



#### GlobalCoder: Purpose and Value-Statement:

Individual Information Management and Tracking
FOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




-[Instructor - features:]
    -Presentation - mode -> non window specific drawing
    -Keys-Screen-Display - Shows Key shortcuts on screen of typed code
    -- allows for better OCR-ing of CODE, READABILITY, and ultimately 
    communication EFFECTIVENESS
    -Non window specific note-taking
        -day specific, project specific, use-case specific, feature specific


-[ STUDENT ]
    - WINDOW Tracking
    - 
        -NON-SPECIFIC:
            - non window specific note-taking
            - non window specific doc reference for code Language
            - non window specific code intellisense/ cursor functionality within all IDEs/Editors
            - non window specific GLOBAL-Computer:
                /STAT Tracking 
                / Logging, 
                /Data capture, 
                /archiving, and
                /implimentation-Of

        *WINDOW-SPECIFICs:*
            - functionlity and referencing 
            - information Identificaiton /

        / long-term optimization of workflow and meeting flow

    i.e.
     *NON IDE-SPECIFIC CODING*
        ( universal editor-likeness )
        -hotkeys to remap/changing IDE shortcut keys to map to 
        -hotkeys converted to hotstring/menu items per window-instance
